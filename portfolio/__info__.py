    A passionate Software Engineer with experience in Python, Rust, API development,
    and more. I love optimizing code and automating processes to create efficient and robust
    solutions. During my career, I've been working on solving mathematical problems through
    optimization problems, also working directly on product, making everything general,
    flexible and robust. I also worked on improving the APIs, increasing performance and reducing
    complexity of different kinds of problems.
